<p>After logging in and selecting your Basecamp account, you should be presented with a list of projects in that account. &nbsp;In the example screen shot below, we have three different projects in our account.</p>

<p><img alt="" height="239" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/project_list.png" width="430" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two types of items in Basecamp that Projectite can make a schedule out of, todo items, and calendar entries. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">Clicking the small triangle next to a project will cause Projectite to load all of the todo lists and calendar entries for that project. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color: white;">In the &quot;Scheduling Application&quot; project from the previous screenshot, we have an &quot;Engineering&quot; and an &quot;Ops&quot; todo list. &nbsp;In each of those we have several todo items assigned to various people. &nbsp;The screenshot below shows what we see&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;after opening our project for the first time. &nbsp;Notice the blue I-Beam on the &quot;Set up database cluster&quot; todo item. &nbsp;This represents a due date that was set in Basecamp.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" height="332" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/todo_lists.png" width="515" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>You can click on a todo item to edit it&#39;s details that describe how it should be scheduled. &nbsp;On this screen, the name, whom it&#39;s assigned to, and the due date all come directly from Basecamp. &nbsp;If you edit them here, they will update in Basecamp. &nbsp;The rest of the fields are specific to Projectite. &nbsp;In the screenshot below, I&#39;ve filled in the start and end date of this todo item.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" height="390" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/edit_item.png" width="607" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>When I close this window, I&#39;ll be able to see a bar drawn for that todo item.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" height="416" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/first_bar.png" width="607" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t always have to specify a start and an end date to make a bar appear on your GANTT chart. &nbsp;Sometimes, you want some tasks to always follow others. &nbsp;To do this, edit a todo item and fill in the predecessor and duration values.</p>

<p>Note: When you have a predecessor set, the start and end dates become disabled. &nbsp;To re-enable them, click the &quot;Clear&quot; button next to the predecessor option.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" height="417" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/predeccessors.png" width="607" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>After setting up a predecessor, you&#39;ll see &nbsp;a line drawn between the two todo items and the second one will automatically be placed in the correct position. &nbsp;When the first todo item moves, the second will move with it.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pred-arrows.png" /><img alt="" height="420" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pred-arrows.png" width="612" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Sometimes, you want to filter your schedule so you&#39;re only looking at specific people. &nbsp;To do this, click the person&#39;s name on the right hand side. &nbsp;This is a good way to find out if one person is overbooked. &nbsp;You can even open multiple projects at once and search for a person. &nbsp;You can select multiple people as well. &nbsp;To go back to viewing everyone, you can either select everyone, or select nobody.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" height="422" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/resourcefilter.png" width="616" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can be very time consuming to set up your project for the first time. &nbsp;There is an autoschedule button in the upper right hand corner (it looks like a genie&#39;s lamp). &nbsp;After clicking that, you&#39;ll be brought to the autoschedule options window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" height="395" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/autoschedule.png" width="576" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Autoschedule will make some guesses about your schedule and set up a baseline that you can then go edit. &nbsp;For an example, if I let Projectite autoschedule my example project by resource, I&#39;d get something like the following:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" height="413" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/auto_result-1.png" width="603" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>As you work, Projectite is automatically saving your work. &nbsp;There&#39;s no need to explicitly save. &nbsp;When you&#39;re ready to share your project with others, you can select the &quot;Export PDF&quot; link at the top.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><img alt="" src="https://projectite-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pdf_options.png" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Select the projects you want to export, and then either click the Post or the Download button. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Posting, will cause a copy of your schedule to be posted in a message directly to your basecamp account. &nbsp;It will use the message and body fields above in those posted messages.</span></p>

<p><span>Downloading will allow you to download a PDF for printing, emailing, etc. &nbsp;When you download, the body and title are ignored.</span></p>

<p><span>An example pdf is shown here:</span></p>
